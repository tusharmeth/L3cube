TXTFS (txtfs.py)
1.  Application will only create/copy/print *text* files

2. Application will only allow copying contents from external 
   files(eg : /usr/readme.txt can be copied to readme.txt created by the application); 
   it won't allow editing of contents.

3. Application will act as a command interpreter and accept only five commands 
   create, copy, echo, ls  and delete with relevant parameters ; all text files directly
   go into Textfs without any folder structure.
